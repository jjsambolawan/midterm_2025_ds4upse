    "# ECON 138 — Midterm Exam  \n",
    "### *How Do Maternal and Child Health Outcomes Differ Across Southeast Asia?*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:**  \n",
    "This exam will assess your ability to perform *exploratory data analysis (EDA)* and create *visual stories* using real-world microdata.  \n",
    "You will use the **Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) Phase 7 – Birth Recode (BR)** datasets from Southeast Asian countries to compare maternal and child health outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Backgound\n",
    "The DHS provides nationally representative data on fertility, maternal and child health, and family planning.  \n",
    "Each “BR” dataset contains one record per live birth reported by women aged 15–49.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Country | DHS file | Phase | Year |\n",
    "|----------|-----------|-------|------|\n",
    "| Cambodia | `KHBR73FL.DTA` | 7 | 2014 |\n",
    "| Indonesia | `IDBR71FL.DTA` | 7 | 2017 |\n",
    "| Myanmar | `MMBR71FL.DTA` | 7 | 2016 |\n",
    "| Philippines | `PHBR71FL.DTA` | 7 | 2017 |\n",
    "| Timor-Leste | `TLBR71FL.DTA` | 7 | 2016 |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Your output should **not only consist of tables and charts**, but also **narrative insights and interpretations**.  \n",
    "For every visualization or descriptive table you produce, include a short **Markdown discussion (2–4 sentences)** explaining:\n",
    "- What the data show  \n",
    "- How patterns differ across countries or socio-economic groups  \n",
    "- What potential economic, demographic, or policy interpretations can be drawn  \n",
    "\n",
    "These narratives are essential for demonstrating your understanding of the data and your ability to communicate findings effectively, similar to how economists write data briefs or empirical summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Preparation\n",
    "1. Load each `.dta` file using `pandas.read_stata()`.  \n",
    "2. Create a `country` column (e.g., “Cambodia”, “Indonesia”, etc.) and concatenate all countries into one DataFrame.  \n",
    "3. Always use survey weights in summaries."
